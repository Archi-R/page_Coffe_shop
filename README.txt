A Pen created at CodePen.io. You can find this one at http://codepen.io/mur/pen/bNByOj.

 I was playing around with website footers at work and wanted to get a little creative, I came across this pen (http://codepen.io/hudsonmarinho/pen/FHGeK) and decided to see if I could simplify/improve on it.

Started as PureCSS but in order to make the height of the footer modify the margin-bottom of the content area, Javascript was unfortunately needed. I've included some other variables for the sake of attaching the background (purely for cosmetic effect really).
